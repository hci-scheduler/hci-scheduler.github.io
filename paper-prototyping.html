		<h2>Briefing</h2>
		<p>
			Hi. We are designing a scheduler for students that will allow them to easily schedule and plan out their classes, homework for their classes, and any other events they may have to do during the week.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are currently looking for people to test an early paper prototype of our interface. The information collected is for the class Human Computer Interaction instructed by Professor Bickmore in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop at any time. We will not use your results if this is the case. If you do agree to help us test, we will not record or publish any information with your name. Would you be willing to test our prototype?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks. As I stated before we are creating a scheduler for students. We will give you three tasks to complete. We believe these tasks will be the most used actions in our app so we wanted to see what further improvements could be made.
		</p>
		<p>
			While testing the interface one of us, the computer, will be moving around elements of the prototype as you interact with it. The computer cannot speak so they will not respond to you but you should verbalize any thoughts you have about the prototype, for example what you like, what you don’t like, what you think could be improved, or any questions that you have.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may not answer your question immediately as we want to improve the interface so that it answers those questions for you. If you get stuck for too long in a certain section, we will help you so that you can complete the section.
		</p>
		<h2>Schedule Squid Usability Test</h2>
		<p>Date of Report: November 4, 2015</p>
		<p>Date of Test: November 1, 2015</p>
		<p>Location of Test: Boston, MA</p>
		<p>Prepared for: Prof. Timothy Bickmore</p>
		<p>Email: is4300f15 at ccs.neu.edu</p>
		<p>Prepared by: Schedule Squid</p>
		<p>Website: http://hci-scheduler.github.io</p>
		
		<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
		<p>
			The main goal of the study is to gain feedback for the application, Schedule Squid, to identify improvements and errors in completing tasks. The sessions were conducted for 15 minutes with 4 different participants. All participants were able to complete all 3 tasks. Some participants had a little difficulty completing the task of Adding an Assignment because the “Add” button was not visible enough, which prompted the user to think that they have to add by clicking on the dates on the calendar. Overall, users found the application simple to use and rated their satisfaction of the app with an average of a 6 (1-7 scale rating).
		</p>
		
		<h2>Methodology</h2>

		<h3>What participants did</h3>
		<p>
			Participants met with the facilitator for about 15 minutes each. All participants were asked to complete 3 short tasks. During each task, they were asked to talk through their thought process. At the end of the testing, a brief interview was conducted to get user feedback and recommendations.
		</p>
		<h3>What data we collected</h3>
		<p>
			Every user completed all 3 tasks. The first task of Adding a Course was completed with an average time of 5 minutes and 48 seconds, the second task of Adding an Assignment was completed with an average time of 4 minutes and 20 seconds, and the third task of Viewing and Assignment was completed with an average time of 58 seconds. Overall users gave positive ratings but there were some suggestions given to help improve the application as well.
		</p>
		<h2>Major findings and recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Major issues</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Time consuming to choose Month, Day, and Year separately from drop down menus.</li>
			<li>Users wanted to add Course or Assignments by clicking on dates on the calendar itself.</li>
			<li>One user had difficulty finding the “Add” button.</li>
			<li>Did not want to include “Assignment Details” or “Course Description”.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Instead of choosing Month, Day, Year from drop down menu, have a calendar pop up for users to select exact date from the calendar.</li>
			<li>When users click on a date in their scheduler, have a popup that allows them to add Courses or Assignments straight from there.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Or make “Add” button on the top right bigger so it’s easier for users to see</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Make Assignment Details and Course Information an optional field.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Scenario 1 - Adding a Course</h3>
		<p><em>
			It’s the beginning of the semester and you would like to add your Eng1111 course into Schedule Squid so you know when you need to attend class. The class meets on Wednesday and Fridays at 12pm – 1:30pm in Ryder220. Your professor’s name is Ben Parker and his email is parker@neu.edu. The class website is eng111.neu.edu where you will find the course information and syllabus. There are a few books you need to acquire for the class and would like to keep a note of it. The books are “First Year English” by M. P. Smith and “Writing 101” by S. Read. Your class starts on September 3, 2015 and ends December 15, 2015.
