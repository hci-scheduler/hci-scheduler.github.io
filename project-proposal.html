		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>
			A lot of students have issues keeping their life together - and who could blame them? College presents a whole new world with so many things to do and people to schedule meetings with. The main issue is that students often forget that they should be putting things in their calendar - something that seems trivial but is so often forgotten. Our application aims to solve common issues that users have with schedulers, such as poor layout or ugly design. In addition, we want to address a problem that is equally as important, which is reminding users that they should actually be USING the scheduler to their advantage, instead of forgetting to write things down.
		</p>
		<h2>Target User</h2>
		<p>
			Our application will be useful for any student, but our main target users will be college students. College students’ schedules can get quite hectic when juggling classes, work, and extra-curricular activities. Their typical planners can get cluttered and be overwhelming to look at. Our application will help solve some of these problems. It will show the student’s class schedule so that they know what classes they will be going to, and also the homeworks due for all their classes. Having a planner where they can easily view when their assignments are due and getting reminders to actually do their homework, will help them to better schedule their time around their classwork. Ultimately, our application will provide a way for busy students to not only keep organized, but to also better manage their time. 
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>
			Our solution is a scheduling application intended to help students remove the clutter from their schedules and become more organized.  This will be a desktop application built using Java.  Using our application, users would be able to see their class schedule for the week, complete with information such as the class names, times, and locations.  On a sidebar users would a list of homework assignments organized by course.  Here they could add new assignments, or view descriptions of the assignments they have.  They would also have the ability to display an assignment (or assignments) on the calendar, showing the dates that they’re due.  After a user has gone to a class on their schedule, the application will prompt them to add any new assignments they may have been given.  Users would also be able to set reminders for themselves to start assignments, either based on a desired time or something like “3 days before this assignment is due”.  Ideally, our application built with college students in mind would make it easier for those students to keep themselves organized than a more general planner.
