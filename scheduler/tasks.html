		<h2>Briefing</h2>
		<p>
			Hi. We are designing a scheduler for students that will allow them to easily schedule and plan out their classes, homework for their classes, and any other events they may have to do during the week.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are currently looking for people to test an early paper prototype of our interface. The information collected is for the class Human Computer Interaction instructed by Professor Bickmore in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop at any time. We will not use your results if this is the case. If you do agree to help us test, we will not record or publish any information with your name. Would you be willing to test our prototype?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks. As I stated before we are creating a scheduler for students. We will give you three tasks to complete. We believe these tasks will be the most used actions in our app so we wanted to see what further improvements could be made.
		</p>
		<p>
			While testing the interface one of us, the computer, will be moving around elements of the prototype as you interact with it. The computer cannot speak so they will not respond to you but you should verbalize any thoughts you have about the prototype, for example what you like, what you don’t like, what you think could be improved, or any questions that you have.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may not answer your question immediately as we want to improve the interface so that it answers those questions for you. If you get stuck for too long in a certain section, we will help you so that you can complete the section.
		</p>
		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<p>
			TASK 1 - Add a course - It’s the beginning of the semester and you would like to add your Eng1111 course into Schedule Squid so you know when you need to attend class. The class meets on Wednesday and Fridays at 12pm – 1:30pm in Ryder220. Your professor’s name is Ben Parker and his email is parker@neu.edu. The class website is eng111.neu.edu where you will find the course information and syllabus. There are a few books you need to acquire for the class and would like to keep a note of it. The books are “First Year English” by M. P. Smith and “Writing 101” by S. Read. Your class starts on September 3, 2015 and ends December 15, 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
			TASK 2 - Add an assignment - You have received an assignment for your Eng1111 class due at noon on Wednesday, 10/28/2015. Put it in your Schedule Squid calendar so that you remember to complete it! Some details for your essay include: 5 pages in length and a paper copy must be printed out and turned in. 
		</p>
		<p>
			TASK 3 - View assignments - It is time to do your assignments. You know that you have an Eng1111 essay due but you do not remember the date that it is due. Please login to your Schedule Squid to view your assignment.
